# Student Enrollment Form using JsonPowerDB

## Description

This is a web-based Student Enrollment Form built using HTML, JavaScript, and JsonPowerDB. The form allows users to add and update student records in a real-time database through a clean and interactive interface. The application ensures that each studentâ€™s data is uniquely identified by their Roll Number (primary key) and enables quick CRUD operations.

The form supports:
- Validating and capturing student details
- Saving new entries if the Roll Number is not found
- Updating existing records if the Roll Number already exists
- Resetting the form to its initial state
